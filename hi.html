<p>Summary: When Kaveh discovers that Alhaitham has been reading a book about human sexuality and kinks, he generously offers to assist Alhaitham with some sexual exploration. <br>
It’s a risky proposal, and one that could end very badly—thanks to their falling-out years ago, the two of them have trust issues galore.</p>
<p>But it turns out that Kaveh and Alhaitham are surprisingly good at trust and communication when it comes to sex… <br>
which raises some questions about the nature of their relationship, and where exactly this whole experiment is leading them.</p>

<p><i>Psst... sneak peek here...</i></p>
<h4>Chapter One</h4>
<p>When Kaveh emerges from his room after three hours of nonstop sketching, he expects to find Alhaitham sitting on the couch reading a book—and<br>
that’s more or less what he finds, except for two key differences.</p>
<p>One is that the book is abandoned on Alhaitham’s lap, about to topple off his knees.</p>
<p>The other is that instead of reading, Alhaitham is sucking on two of his fingers, lips stretched wide as he contemplates the far wall.</p>
<p>That sight sends a jolt of arousal straight to Kaveh’s cock, so intense that it pisses him off. “What the fuck are you doing?” he says.</p>
<p>Alhaitham’s eyes flick to him, and he slowly removes his fingers from his mouth. A string of saliva clings to his skin, dripping down his knuckles,<br>
and he frowns at the mess, perhaps realizing that he has no towel to wipe it off. “Do you need something?” he asks, as if Kaveh hadn’t just walked<br>
in on him sucking his damn fingers like he's in an erotic novel.  </p>
<p>“Yes, in fact,” Kaveh says. “What I <i>need,</i> Alhaitham, is an explanation for why you’re engaging in borderline masturbatory activities in our living room.”<br>
When Alhaitham coolly raises an eyebrow, Kaveh snaps, “Oh, are you going to tell me there’s a completely innocent reason for why you were<br>
practically gagging on your fingers just now?”</p>
<p>“I don’t see why it’s your business,” Alhaitham says. “And it’s not ‘our’ living room. It’s mine. I’m simply allowing you to use it,<br>
along with the rest of the house.”</p>
<p>“By that logic, should I worry that I’ll walk in here one day and find you sitting here with your dick out? Do I need to confine myself to my bedroom<br>
and exit the house through the window, to protect my eyes? Or perhaps you’ll say that my bedroom is technically yours, too, and that nowhere in<br>
this godforsaken house is safe?”
<p>“I have no intention of masturbating in your bedroom.” Scowling, Alhaitham wipes his fingers on his pants and picks his book up, signalling that<br>
the conversation is over.</p>
<p>Kaveh suspects that Alhaitham didn’t rule out the other options solely for the sake of<br>
riling him up; he doubts that he’ll actually get an eyeful of Alhaitham’s dick the next time he walks into the kitchen for a glass of water. But he won’t take the bait.<br>
He’s more mature than that. “What were you even trying to do, then?”</p>
<p>“I was verifying something I read in this book,” Alhaitham answers. “You should try doing that more often, instead of believing everything you’re told.”</p>
<p>“I do not believe everything I’m told,” Kaveh snaps. “It’s called giving people the benefit of the doubt, Alhaitham. You should try doing that more often.”<br>
He folds his arms and glares at Alhaitham, who is pointedly staring at the book instead of Kaveh. “And ‘something you read’? What kind of book is that, even? A guide on how to harass other people?<br>
A Treatise on New and Creative Ways to Piss Off and Horrify Your Poor Beleaguered Roommate, perhaps?</p>
<p>Alhaitham reaches up to fiddle with his headphones. Although Kaveh figures that he hasn’t actually turned on the noise-cancelling function—since<br> 
Alhaitham prefers to drive Kaveh insane by ignoring him the old-fashioned way—he can’t be certain.</p>
<p>Huffing, Kaveh marches across the room and snatches the book from Alhaitham’s hands, holding it open to the page he was reading. He doesn’t check the title right away, though.<br>
He keeps his eyes carefully trained on Alhaitham’s face, searching for those subtle flickers of emotion that Alhaitham doesn’t always manage to immediately hide.</p>
<p>Currently, Alhaitham’s expression is neutral—but there’s a blush pinkening his cheeks, and it seems like he’s clenching his jaw.</p>
<p>Ha. He can try to act unruffled all he wants; Kaveh sees through him like a set of muslin curtains.</p>
<p>“Let’s see,” Kaveh says, flipping over the book to read the title. “Considerations on Human Sexuality and Arousal: A psycholog…” He chokes on the rest of the title.<br>
“A psychological exploration of common and uncommon triggers?!”</p>
<p>“Congratulations,” Alhaitham says. “You’re literate enough to read a book title.”</p>
<p>“Oh my gods.” Kaveh flips the book over and checks what page Alhaitham was on. “Finger sucking. You really were…oh.”<br>
He glances between the book and Alhaitham’s unimpressed stare, trying to wrap his mind around the fact that<br>
not only was Alhaitham reading about triggers for arousal, but imagining them for himself.</p>
<p>“Are you done gawking at my book? It’s not as if you’ve never seen one before.” Alhaitham rolls his eyes.<br>
“Snatching things from other people’s hands like a child stealing toys. You’re as uncouth as ever.”</p>
<p>“I—me? I’m uncouth? I’m not the one testing out kinks in the middle of the living room!”</p>
<p>Kaveh can’t get that blasted image out of his mind: Alhaitham sitting casually on the couch, fingers shoved in his mouth, looking not the least bit uncomfortable.<br>
He wonders what Alhaitham would sound like if he tried to speak around those fingers, if he moaned around those fingers.<br>
Wonders what his lips would look like stretched around three instead of two,<br>
what he’d look like with drool dripping down his chin, what he’d look like with an actual cock in his mouth.</p>

<p><i>Fuck.</i> Kaveh is turned on now, and it’s all Alhaitham’s fault.</p>
